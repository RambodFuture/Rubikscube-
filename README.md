# Rubikscube-
This project implements a Rubik's Cube model in Java, complete with rotation logic, state tracking, and iterator-based traversal.
It supports:
* Cube initialization and visualization
* Face rotations (clockwise and counterclockwise)
* Iterator patterns for cube traversal
* Reversible operations and state inspection
* Designed for testing, extension, and algorithmic experimentation
